The run_analysis.R script cleans the data in line with the procedure set out in the project requirements

The dataset was manually downloaded with this link, to my personal device
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Each piece of data was read into R Studio using read.table() function with col.names argument used.

Assign each data to variables then merges the training and the test sets to create one data set...

X :x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y :y_train and y_test using rbind() function
ID (can be viewed as participants identifiers): subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
TidyData (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Retains only the columns interested in which are cols that contain mean or std, also subject and code...
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Done by using join function, no need to state x as all connected by piping "%>%"
* for neatness, moves activity column to left hand side of dataset and removes "code" columns as is now redundant with full activity names also present *

Changes notation of features to be more intuitive using gsub regular expression
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

Finally creates FinalData by first grouping by activity and subject then simply taking the means
